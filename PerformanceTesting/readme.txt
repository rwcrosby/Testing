Overview 
========
Passmark's PerformanceTest for Linux/Mac is a software tool that allows everybody to quickly assess the performance of their computer and compare it to a number of standard 'baseline' computer systems.

============
Unzip the executable from the downloaded zip file using "unzip pt_linux_<arch>.zip"

How to launch application
==========================
To run application via the command line, from your terminal:
	1. Change the current working directory to where you have unzipped PerformanceTest
	2. Launch PerformanceTest using the command ./pt_linux_<arch>

System Requirements
======================

11.0 Build 1000 - 1st May 2023
- Updated version number to 11 to match current Windows release
- Added extra timeout lengths based on test thread count to CPU test (30 seconds for > 200, 60 seconds for > 500)

10.2 Build 1003 - 27th June 2022
- Remove (TM) and (R) from CPU name

10.2 Build 1002 - 17th May 2022
